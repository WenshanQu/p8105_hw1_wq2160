## Create a data frame ** hw1_df ** comprised of: 1). a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution; 2). a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0; 3). a character vector of length 10; 4). a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

```{r}
## create the data frame "hw1_df"
hw1_df =
  tibble(
    sample = rnorm(10),
    gr_than_0 = sample > 0,
    vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3), 
                        levels = c("1", "2", "3"))
  )

## show the data frame
hw1_df
```
