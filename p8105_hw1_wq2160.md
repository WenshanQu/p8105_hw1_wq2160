## Create a data frame hw1\_df comprised of: 1). a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution; 2). a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0; 3). a character vector of length 10; 4). a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

``` r
## create the data frame "hw1_df"
hw1_df =
  tibble(
    sample = rnorm(10),
    gr_than_0 = sample > 0,
    vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    vec_factor = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3), 
                        levels = c("1", "2", "3"))
  )

## show the data frame
hw1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    sample gr_than_0 vec_char vec_factor
    ##     <dbl> <lgl>     <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1  0.312 TRUE      a        1         
    ##  2  0.578 TRUE      b        1         
    ##  3  0.572 TRUE      c        2         
    ##  4 -1.11  FALSE     d        3         
    ##  5 -0.823 FALSE     e        3         
    ##  6  0.182 TRUE      f        3         
    ##  7 -0.633 FALSE     g        2         
    ##  8  0.281 TRUE      h        3

## Take the mean of each variable:

``` r
## take the mean of sample
hw1_df %>% pull(sample) %>% mean()
```

    ## [1] -0.1291716

``` r
mean(hw1_df$sample)
```

    ## [1] -0.1291716

``` r
## take the mean of logical vector
hw1_df %>% pull(gr_than_0) %>% mean()
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(hw1_df$gr_than_0)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
## take the mean of character vector
hw1_df %>% pull(vec_char) %>% mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(hw1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(hw1_df$vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
## take the mean of factor vector
hw1_df %>% pull(vec_factor) %>% mean()
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(.): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(hw1_df$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

## The result above shows that the variable “sample” and “logical factor” could be taken the mean, while the “character factor” and “factor vector” could not.

## Then, we convert the type of variables:

``` r
as.numeric(hw1_df$sample)
```

    ##  [1]  0.3119435  0.5779629  0.5718142 -1.1067878 -0.8231199  0.1816425
    ##  [7] -0.6328061  0.2813379  1.0690233 -1.7227269

``` r
as.numeric(hw1_df$gr_than_0)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

``` r
as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_factor)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 2 3 3 3 2 3 1 3

## The variable type of “sample” and “logical vector” could be converted, the “character factor” could not be converted because it is nominal data. As for “factor vector”, I defined it as numeric factor so it could be converted to numbers here; but if I denined it as “male”, “female”, and “prefer not to say”, then it could NOT be converted and the output will be “NA”.

## Another thing about the “factor vector” is that: Why the mean of vec\_factor could not be calculated but it could be converted to numbers. My explanition is: in the data frame, I defined vec\_factor using `c()`, so even the factors are actually numbers, they are not considered as numbers by R (they are considered more like “text”). But because they are really numbers, they could be converted to numbers using `as.numeric` function.
